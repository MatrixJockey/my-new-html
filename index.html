    <h3>The advancement of technologies powering sustainable energy</h3>
    <p>
        Legacy automakers have been lagging behind in their acceptance of electric vehicles
        and the core technologies that lay the foundation for sustainable mobility.
        Because of the popularization of EVs by industry disruptors such as TESLA.
        It is the responsibility of legacy automakers to invest heavily in upgrading manufacturing techniques and facilities to increase the output of their EVs.
        The key components underlining the powertrain for Evs include: the electric motor, battery chemistry/form for incorporation into a modular battery pack, electronics, and infotainment system.
